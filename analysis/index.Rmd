Welcome to my research website.

## QC
- [fastqc](../output/multiqc.html)

### Genotype data
- [Genotype call rates]()
- [kinship](20190321_Check-Kinship-And-PopulationStructure.html)
- [PCA](20190326_PCA.html)
- [Admixture](20190326_Admixture.html)

### Expression data
- [Check that RNA-seq data segregates by biological sample over sequencing flow cell](20190325_MergingRNASeqLanes.html)
- [Checking RNA-seq data for covariates](20190320_Check-RNAseq-PCs.html)
- [STAR Aligner vs kallisto pseudoaligner for gene quantification](20190429_RNASeqSTAR_quantifications.html)

### Prepare data for eQTL testing
- [Make phenotype table for testing](20190327_MakeFamPhenotypeFile.html)
- [Make covariate table for testing](20190327_MakeCovariateFiles.html)

### Association testing with various models
- [first iteration](20190412_Check_eQTLs.html): description: lmm with KING-robust GRM thresholded at 0, and 3 genotype PCs
- [Check residuals after regressing out some covariates](20190421_RegressOutRNASeqPCs.html)
- [second iteration](20190424_Check_eQTLs.html): description: lm with 5 genotype PCs (PCs 4 and 5 takes into account some first hand relatedness) and more stringent genotype filtering. Also, outlier sample MD_And dropped from analysis
- [Third iteration](20190428_Check_eQTLs.html)
- [fourth iteration](20190502_Check_eQTLs.html): description, lmm with 4 PCs and 3 Genotype PCs, used STAR RNA-seq CPM for less outliers. Fixed big bug that was permuting samples, resulting in no true hits in previous iterations. Here I used standardization and qqnorm.

### Conservation and GO analysis
- [GO analysis, FDR=0.1](20190521_eQTL_CrossSpeciesEnrichment.html) overlap enrichment analysis of eGenes across humans and chumps, and gene ontology analysis of eGenes based on eGene classification defined at FDR=0.1 threshold
- [Conservation analysis, FDR=0.1](20190606_eGene_Conservation.html) analysis of conservation of coding sequence (percent identity and dN/dS) based on eGene classification defined at FDR=0.1
