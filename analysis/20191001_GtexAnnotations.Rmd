From my dataset of gene expression measurements across 39 chimp individuals (RNA-seq from heart tissue) and ~39 human individuals (~50 RNA-seq sampels randomly chosen from human GTEx datasets, then culled to exclude outliers and lowly sequenced samples) I am interested in quantifying gene expression dispersion within each population. I had [previously]() made the observation that gene expression overdispersion  is well correlated ($R^2\approx0.5$) between the two species, even after regressing out the fact that variance is correlated to expression (due to both biological and statstical reasons). This amount of correlation is higher than I would have guessed, given how small the overlap is between eGenes that I could detect. However, I still don't have a sense of what I should have expected. To gain some intuition on this, I would like to use other GTEx tissues to estimate gene-wise overdispersion parameters, and compare the correlation across tissues. First, let's peruse the GTEx samples available to us, to pick ~40 reasonable samples per tissue for this analysis.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

Samples <- read.table("../data/GTExAnnotations/GTEx_Analysis_v8_Annotations_SampleAttributesDS.txt", header=T, sep='\t', quote="")
Subjects <- read.table("../data/GTExAnnotations/GTEx_Analysis_v8_Annotations_SubjectPhenotypesDS.txt", header=T, sep='\t')
GtexColors <- read.table("../data/GTEx_Analysis_TissueColorCodes.txt", sep='\t', header=T, stringsAsFactors = F) %>% mutate(HEX=paste0("#",Color.code))

TissueColorVector <- GtexColors$HEX
names(TissueColorVector)<-GtexColors$Tissue

#Num samples per tissue. Note that I may want to filter out some samples to draw from ones where experimental protocols (like RNA extraction method) were kept reasonably constant
Samples %>%
  filter(SMAFRZE=="RNASEQ") %>%
  count(SMTSD,SMNABTCHT) %>%
  filter(SMTSD %in% GtexColors$Tissue) %>% mutate(sum=sum(n)) %>%

#sample type. RNASEQ type was deemed suitable for GTEx v8 eQTL calling

#Now let's randomly pick ~40 samples that are  TruSeq.v1 and have coverage comparable to my ChimpSamples (~70M mapped reads), and are similar in other metrics (RNA Extraction from Paxgene-derived Lysate Plate Based).

Separate topic:
Write out list of acceptable samples to draw from for re-calling eQTLs from GTEx data with smaller sample sizes (n=40)

```{r}
Covariates <- read.table("../data/GTEx_Heart_v8_covariates.txt", header=T)

HeartSamples <- SamplesFilteredForTissuesSuitableForAnalysis %>%
  filter(SMTSD=="Heart - Left Ventricle") %>%
  mutate(CovariateID = paste0("GTEX.",IndidualID)) %>% 
  filter(CovariateID %in% colnames(Covariates)) %>% dplyr::select(CovariateID) %>%
  write.table("../data/GTEx_Heart_v8_AcceptableSampleList.txt", row.names = F, col.names = F, quote=F)
  

```
